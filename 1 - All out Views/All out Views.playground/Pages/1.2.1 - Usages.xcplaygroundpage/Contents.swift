/*:
 ‚ö†Ô∏è `ContainerExample` and `StoredInContainerExample` might look the same but there is a subtle difference.
 In the former we're computing the `View` inside of the `init`, whereas here, the closure that computes the `View` will be stored. Make sure to check out the `Bonus` section for more on why the former is better than the later.

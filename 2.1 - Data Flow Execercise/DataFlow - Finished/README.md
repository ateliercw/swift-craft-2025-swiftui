#  Data Flow - Hands on

This app lets you enter some information about a session, take notes, and rate it.

The tasks to complete in this exercise are:

- Add a notes view model that contains
    - A `String` to store notes
    - An `Int?` rating
- Add that view model as a property of the `RootViewModel`

- Create a notes that allows the user to input notes, and set the rating to either none or a value of 1 to 5.
- Display the notes and rating on the root view in a format that can't be edited

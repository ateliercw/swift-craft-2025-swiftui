# Animations - Hands on

This app has a handful of views with features to implement based on what we learned in this section:

## ScrollingView

- Use `onGeometryChange` to make the `ScrollTrackingView` update it's content in response to how much the user has scrolled
- Add a `.scrollTransition` modifier to the `ScrollTrackingView` that fades it out as it scrolls off the top of the screen.

/*: # Geometry
 
 While reading sizes and dictating frames feels very imperative, there are scenarios where we need to know the size or position of a View. Mostly so that we can take decisions for other Views as well.
 
 üëç Our suggestion and approach is to always try to respect a View's intrinsic content size and when you want to constrain `View` in terms of their size, do it loosely. e.g. `.frame(minWidth:minHeight:)` or `.frame(maxWidth:maxHeight:)` rather than absolute values. This helps with certain aspects of accessibility too.
 
 This is where `GeometryReader` comes into play and gives us access to those readings thought the `GeometryProxy` parameter.
 This `View` is notorious by now for being inefficient and sloppy, not intuitive to use and requiring a lot of boilerplate code to setup in order to read and pass that information up the chain.
 Luckily we got an updated new API: `.onGeometryChange(for:of:action:)` which is both more elegant and a bit more streamlined with the way the API communicated: it's only triggered when the geometry changed.
 
 ## CoordinateSpace
 
 As previously seen, `GeometryReader` is a `View` whose content creation block provides as parameter a `GeometryProxy` object. Amongst the usual `.size` property, there is another interesting API:
 
 ```swift
 üí° func bounds(of coordinateSpace: NamedCoordinateSpace) -> CGRect?
 func frame(in coordinateSpace: CoordinateSpace) -> CGRect
 ```
 but what is a `CoordinateSpace`?
 Looking at its definition we find it to be a simple enum:
 
 ```swift
 public enum CoordinateSpace {

	 case global
	 case local
	 case named(AnyHashable)
 }
 ```
 The cases are fairly straightforward: `global` will return the frame of the container in the current context, `local` will return the same `size` as `global`, but the `origin` will always be `.zero`.
 The interesting case, though, is the `named`. It allows us to reference other `CoordinateSpaces`, each `View` has an associated `CoordinateSpace`, so basically, the frame of a `View` that is currently visible on the screen.
 The counterpart API for allowing us to name `CoordinateSpaces` can be found on `View`:
 ```swift
 @inlinable public func coordinateSpace<T>(name: T) -> some View where T : Hashable
 ```

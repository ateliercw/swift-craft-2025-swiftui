/*: # Layouts

 In UIKit, layouts are often handled very explicitly either with constraints that can be shared across many layers of the view hierarchy, or by directly manipulating view frame. This style of layout doesn't work well with the layout system in SwiftUI, so we need to learn some new strategies to implement out layouts.

 Well, that's not entirely true: `UIStackView` is the grandfather of HStack/ VStack or other declarative style containers: you just provide an array of views and it handles their layout automatically.
